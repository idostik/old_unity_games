# Old unity games
This repository contains all of my old Unity games that I created between 2019-2021. Some of them are unfinished. 
I was just starting with programming around that time, so the code is probably pretty rough.

TODO
- Test which games work
- Add binaries for running them
- Add Readmes with description and screenshots to all of them
